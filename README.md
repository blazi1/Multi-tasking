Are women better than men at multi-tasking?

The project will consist in replicating the paper (Stoet et al.) which tried to verify the common belief that women are better at multi-tasking than men. To check this, they designed two experiments. In the first one, computer-based task switching paradigm was used, and in the second one, paper-and-pencil multi-tasking tests were used.

According to Stoet et al. (2013), multi-tasking can be defined in two ways: as performing several tasks sequentially/interchangeably or as performing several tasks simultaneously. It is the first sense that is used in the paper by Stoet et al. (2013) to check whether women perform better than men in task-switching.
